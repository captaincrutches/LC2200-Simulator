The LC2200-Simulator folder should be an eclipse project you can import, unless I screwed up and .gitignore'd something important.


To build: right click ant-build.xml in eclipse -> run as -> ant build

You can probably also do that from a command line but I can't be bothered to figure out how


To run: run LC2200-Simulator.java in eclipse, or from a command line "java -jar jar/LC2200-Simulator.jar" (assuming you've built it already)


All this may be subject to change depending on class stuff but I figured I'd put up a skeleton (no spoop pls) because I'm a tryhard
